### 1.1 History Repeats Itself

Old database issues are still relevant today. Many of the ideas in today's database systems are not new.

Somebody invents a "SQL Replacement" every decade. It then fails and/or SQL absorbs the key ideas into the standard.

### 1.2 Integrated Data Store (IDS)

**I**ntegrated **D**ata **S**tore (IDS) was a system developed internally in the 1960s at GE. GE sold their computing division to Honeywell in 1669.

### 1.3 Codasyl

[COBOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL) people got together and created **C**onference **O**n **D**ata **S**ystems **L**anguages (CODASYL) in 1969. They created a standard for how programs will access a database.

- Network data model
- Tuple-at-a-time queries

### 1.4 Network Data Model

Suppose you are a buyer and you need to purchase parts from different suppliers.

The red arrow means pointer which is location of this record on disk or in memory.

### 1.5 Information Management System (IMS)

IBM created **I**nformation **M**anagement **S**ystem (IMS) in 1966. It was built for Apollo moon mission to keep track of all the parts that NASA buying to build rockets. It's still used today in ATM machine or anything on the bank.

### 1.6 Hierarchical Data Model

**Hierarchical Data Model** Provides an interface for programmers to specify which data structure to use for data storage, so when you want to perform a range lookup on the hash table, you must dump all the data and load it back under the new data structure. And programmers need to rewrite application code due to physical data layout changes. **There is a strong coupling between the physical layer and the logical layer**.

### 1.7 Relational Model

Ted Codd was a mathematician at IBM. He wrote a paper in 1970 called "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks". He proposed a new way of storing data that is based on set theory and predicate logic.

The relational model has three key part as backbone of all the modern database systems today.
- Store database in simple data structures
- Access data through high-level language (SQL was not invented yet)
- Physical storage left up to implementation

#### 1.7.1 Early implementations of relational DBMS:
- Peterlee Relational Test Vehicle (PRTV) at IBM
- System R at IBM
- Ingres at UC Berkeley
- Oracle
- Mimer

#### 1.7.2 1980s
- IBM first releases SQL/DS in 1981
- IBM then turns out DB2 in 1983
- "SEQUEL" becomes the standard (SQL) after supposedly Stonebraker refused to talk to the ANSI standards committee.

Stonebraker creates `Postgres` as an "object-relational" database system.

> post ingres => Postgres

### 1.8 Object-Relational Model

Avoid "relational-object impedance mismatch" by tightly coupling objects and database.

The reason why object-relational model failed is that `oql` born too late, and there is a tightly coupling between database and programming language.

The problem is that if you want to update the phone field, then you need a big granularity lock to lock the entire phone to prevent concurrency security issues.

### 1.9 1990s Boring Days

No major advancements in database systems or application workloads.

- Microsoft forks Sybase and create SQL Server.
- MySQL is written as a replacement for mSQL.
- Postgres gets SQL support.
- SQLite started in early 2000.

Some DBMSs introduced pre-computed data cubes for faster analytics.

### 1.10 2000s Data Warehouses

Rise of the special purpose OLAP DBMSs.
- Distributed / Shared-Nothing
- Relational / SQL
- Usually closed-source

Significant performance benefits from using **columnar data storage** model.

### 1.11 2000s MapReduce Systems

Distributed programming and execution model for analyzing large data sets.
- First proposed by Google in 2004 (**MapReduce**).
- Yahoo! created an open-source implementation called **Hadoop**.
- Data model decided by user-written functions.

### 1.12 2000s NoSQL Systems

Focus on high-availability & high-scalability:
- Schema-less
- Non-relational data models (document, key-value, column-family, etc.)
- No ACID transactions
- Custom API instead of SQL
- Usually open-source

### 1.13 2010s NewSQL Systems

Provide same performance for OLTP workloads as NoSQL DBMSs without giving up ACID:
- Relational / SQL
- Distributed

Almost all the first group of systems failed. Second wave of "distributed SQL" systems are (potentially) doing better.

### 1.14 2010s Cloud Systems

First database-as-a-service (DBaaS) offerings were "containerized" versions of existing DBMSs.

There are new DBMSs that are designed from scratch explicitly for running in a cloud environment.

> Designed for cloud => Cloud-native

### 1.15 Shared-Disk Engine

Instead of writing a custom storage manager, the DBMS leverages distributed storage.
- Scale execution layer independently of storage.
- Favors log-stuctured approaches.

This is what most people think of when they talk about a **data lake**.

### 1.16 Graph Systems

Systems for storing and querying graph-structured data.
- Similar to the nerwork data model (CODASYL).

Their (supposed) advantage over other models is to provide a graph-centric query API. However, [SQL:2023](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~boncz/edbt2022.pdf) is adding graph query syntax (SQL/PCG).

Latest [reasearch](https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2023/papers/p66-wolde.pdf) shows that a relational DBMS outperforms SOTA graph DBMSs.

### 1.17 Time Series Systems

Specialized systems that are designed to store time series / event data.

This design of these systems make deep assumptions about the distribution of the data and workload query patterns.

> Andy thinks `ClickHouse` will become a big player in future.

### 1.18 Blockchain Databases

Decentralized distributed log with incremental checksums ([Merkle Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree)).
- Uses Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocol to determine next entry to append to log.

> Andy is not aware of a blockchain usecase that could not also be solved with a "traditional" OLTP DBMS and/or external policies (e.g., authentication).

### 1.19 Specialized Systems

- Embedded DBMSs
- Multi-Model DBMSs
- Hardware Acceleration 
    > During last 40,50 years, people search for hardware acceleration such as gpus or others, but it never pans out due to never gets the adoption in the market
- Array / Matrix / Vector DBMSs
    > You wouldn't want to use a relational DBMS, you want to use a specialized DBMS for this kind of data. We will see whether the market is big enough to justify needing a specialized DBMS. It could be the next thing.

### 1.20 Summary

SQL is considered the way to go forward right now again. An example would be all the nosql systems from 10 years ago, except for Redis, all are died or support SQL. The relation model has stood the test of time.

## Project 1

Build a SQL/MED extension (foreign data wrapper) for PostgreSQL for processing columnar data.
This will expose you to developing for PostgreSQL and building a vectorized execution engine.
